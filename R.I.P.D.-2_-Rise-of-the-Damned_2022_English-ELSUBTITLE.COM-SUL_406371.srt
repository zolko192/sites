1
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,351
Tudom hogy még nem végeztél.

2
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,396
Azt mondod hogy mindened elfogyott,

3
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:46,816
de tudom hogy még mindig van benned egy kis arany.

4
00:02:58,763 --> 00:03:00,806
<i>What in far nation...</i>

5
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:05,621
Hahó, Sheriff.

6
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,290
Uhh Elkaptál.

7
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:09,583
Reggelt.

8
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,381
Apu!

9
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:20,761
Nézz magadra édesem! Ragyogsz akár egy kisbaba.

10
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:22,096
Pörögjél egyet.

11
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:24,890
Whoo! Is this the wedding
dress? Can I have a sneak peek?

12
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:28,144
Don't be a cheat, Daddy. You'll
get a full preview on our big day.

13
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,228
Very soon now.

14
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,147
Can you at least try
and make an effort?

15
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,527
Angus, I see you made
the return trip as well.

16
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,156
A wedding generally is between a
woman and a man, Sheriff Pulsipher.

17
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:43,534
Yes it is, and I can't wait
to meet that young man.

18
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,828
Okay, Daddy.

19
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,455
Listen to me.

20
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:50,040
In five days, Angus will
be a part of this family

21
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,500
whether you like it or not.

22
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:53,335
What I'd like to see
is he's man enough

23
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:55,212
to take over the reins
in protecting you.

24
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:57,047
I mean, is he any good
with a barking iron?

25
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,800
I want a husband, Daddy.
Not a bodyguard.

26
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:02,011
You've taught me how to take
good enough care of myself.

27
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,847
He's taught me how to dissect
the words of Dostoyevsky

28
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,682
and he's introduced me
to Dickens and Poe...

29
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:09,810
You're not even married yet, and
you're already meeting with lawyers?

30
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:11,187
Daddy, stop it.

31
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,441
Angus is a good soul who does
make me feel safe and secure,

32
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,276
but most of all, happy.

33
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:20,654
You're just afraid you won't be the
number one man in my life anymore.

34
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,408
You got him well-trained,
Charlotte, that's for sure.

35
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:26,368
I'm right here.

36
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:34,877
Inside.

37
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,963
Go get 'em, boys!
Round them up!

38
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:39,381
It's the Samuels.

39
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:45,846
Hurry it up, ladies.
I ain't got all day.

40
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,642
Anybody other than me comes
through those doors, you shoot 'em.

41
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:52,937
Move it, move it!

42
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,563
Move it!

43
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:57,608
Daddy? Angus.

44
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,485
How happy does he really
make you? Daddy, go!

45
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,450
You can come out now.

46
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:09,870
Go, go!

47
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:18,837
- Move it!
- Come on, let's go.

48
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:21,173
Keep moving!

49
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,718
First time
I made it on a poster.

50
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:27,388
Hey! I'm handsome!

51
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,473
Hands up!

52
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,434
Come here.

53
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:35,145
Stay down. Go!

54
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:41,503
Don't mind.
Happens to everyone.

55
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:43,714
It's a crazy ride getting here.

56
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:46,592
See?

57
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,677
I just saw the most...

58
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:52,139
Beautiful, bright light you
ever did see? That'd be Heaven.

59
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,183
Heading towards it is a
good sign for your future.

60
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,809
But you haven't
made it there yet.

61
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,436
Hold on!
Hold your damn horses.

62
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:00,898
Did you say Heaven?

63
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,441
I've read your file, Roy.

64
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,151
I know everything about you

65
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,903
and none of it says
you're hard of hearing.

66
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,196
I'm dead?

67
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,405
Mmm-hmm.

68
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,158
Charlotte? What about
my daughter, Charlotte?

69
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,036
Uh, hmm... Negative.

70
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,706
- She's dead.
- She's dead.

71
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,625
No, no. Negative is positive.

72
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,168
Negative means "not dead."

73
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,545
Negative means "not dead"?

74
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,923
That is very confusing.
Change that.

75
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:28,801
But good.

76
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:31,178
She's got her wedding
at the end of the week.

77
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,638
It's in two days, actually.

78
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:33,806
Come again?

79
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,683
You've been dead for three days.

80
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:39,019
It takes a while for
upstairs to ratify judgement

81
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:40,813
and send a soul
to where it belongs.

82
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:42,147
You got sent to us.

83
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,442
Welcome to the RIPD.

84
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,695
The "RIP..." what?

85
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,571
Stands for "department."

86
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,865
The "RIP" is your standard
"Rest in Peace."

87
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,535
I'm the captain of the
West American division.

88
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:55,911
Name's Hano.

89
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:59,581
See, we generally only get
soldiers, warriors and sheriffs

90
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:01,583
who dearly depart
shuffled in here to us.

91
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,544
At least the ones
deemed worthy enough

92
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:07,172
to serve on God's own police force in
the ongoing fight against the deados.

93
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:08,382
The what-os?

94
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,675
The deados.

95
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,845
Souls that escape their
judgment and hang around Earth

96
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,013
like the bad smell they are.

97
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:17,766
Our job is to find them

98
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,270
and send them to where
their ticket got punched.

99
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:22,771
Hmm?

100
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,898
Hell, Roy.
We send them to Hell.

101
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,359
Heaven and Hell?

102
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:29,445
Whoo!

103
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,032
So these souls that escape
their judgement in Hell

104
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:35,909
are what you call "deados."

105
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,287
Not yet. A soul,
by its very definition,

106
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,747
is a spectral energy.

107
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,582
Disembodied, it's ineffectual.

108
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:44,710
To sow the havoc a rogue soul
desires it needs a body.

109
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,795
Wait. A human body?

110
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,088
Exactly.

111
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:51,175
And once it takes one over,
possesses it, if you will,

112
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,926
then it becomes a problem.

113
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,430
Our problem.
It becomes a deado.

114
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,682
The more deados on Earth, the
more unbalanced the natural order,

115
00:09:58,766 --> 00:09:59,808
threatening all human life.

116
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,644
I think you're really
gonna like this.

117
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,150
Whoo-wee.

118
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,778
It's quite an impressive candy
store you got here.

119
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:15,240
Oh, hello.

120
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,075
Ain't you purdy.

121
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,333
That's a very nice choice.

122
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,836
Oh... No, no, no.
I can't be unfaithful.

123
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,507
When it comes to what I wear
on my hip, I'm a one-gun man.

124
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,092
Nothing comes between me
and my Susie.

125
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:35,969
That's my gun.

126
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,596
I call her Susie.

127
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,681
I call her useless.

128
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,892
Especially against deados.

129
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:45,854
It'll stun them for a moment or
two, kind of like a nasty snake bite.

130
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,191
This, however,
more than does the job.

131
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:52,361
With a head shot, these bullets
can exterminate a deado's soul.

132
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,862
And your own,

133
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:56,824
should the barrel end up
being pointed in your direction.

134
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,992
Whoa. Good to know.

135
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,206
What's with the,
uh, hungry snake?

136
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:07,626
The Uroboros signifies
life, death and rebirth.

137
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,879
Deados may look like real
humans, but after possession,

138
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:13,215
that symbol is branded
on their torso.

139
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:15,843
This is a reminder
to all officers

140
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:17,970
of the constant threat
we're up against.

141
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,972
Right. Cut to the chase.
Why am I here?

142
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:23,267
Roy, do you remember that
total eclipse about a month ago?

143
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,061
Well, there was an abnormal
rupture at a gateway near Red Creek,

144
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,938
an old mining town in Utah.

145
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:31,024
"Abnormal," because it
registered with us as a kind of

146
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,694
hellish discharge.

147
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,195
I know an old quack back at home

148
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,657
who has a remedy for "hellish
discharges," if you know what I mean.

149
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,492
Duly noted, but not
what we're looking for.

150
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:43,787
You, however, know that
terrain better than most.

151
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,748
You sign up, we'll get you
back to Earth right away

152
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:48,333
to check it all out.

153
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,252
Now, that's a carrot
worth the dangle.

154
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:54,089
If I get to go back to Earth,
sign me up and count me in!

155
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,592
I know what's going on
in that noggin of yours, Roy.

156
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,303
Everyone in your position
thinks the same thing.

157
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,763
But revenge for your murder
is not the mission.

158
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,557
Getting to Red Creek is.

159
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,601
Let sleeping dogs lie.

160
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,604
You're a dead man. Nothing
we can do can change that.

161
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:09,938
Now, before you read and sign,

162
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,773
you should know
the standard service term...

163
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:14,192
I already said I'm in.
Let's seal the deal.

164
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:15,903
Oh.

165
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,112
Send me back.

166
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,046
You branded me
like a damn steer.

167
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,130
Moo.

168
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:38,050
Now giddy up, cowboy.
It's time to move.

169
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,052
Oh! Watch the bread box.

170
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,970
Sorry. People got taller
over time.

171
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:44,973
We'd like to replace it but, you
know, budgetary constraints.

172
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:47,476
The clock's ticking, Roy.

173
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,520
In two days,
a blood moon will rise.

174
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:53,231
And in the Bible, when that
follows a blue moon eclipse,

175
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:54,900
it can only mean one thing.

176
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,152
A hoot of a time
for astronomers?

177
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,738
The end of times.

178
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,281
Hmm.

179
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:30,769
What the...

180
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,813
Oh, fancy.

181
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,223
Ow.

182
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,232
That's the good thing
about dying.

183
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,152
It can only happen once.

184
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,071
You must be Sheriff Pulsipher.

185
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:24,448
In all my glory.

186
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,367
I have seen glory
and I don't think you are it.

187
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,871
Just who might you be?

188
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:31,997
Jeanne.

189
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:33,123
The name is Jeanne.

190
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,834
Listen, Jane,
I don't do partners.

191
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:39,379
Hano charged me with looking after
you, and I don't go against orders.

192
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:40,672
I don't need no looking after.

193
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:42,257
And I don't need
a fourth partner.

194
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,884
Four partners?
Where are your other three?

195
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:48,263
Everywhere. The Father,
Son and the Holy Ghost.

196
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,640
Oh.

197
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,267
Yeah, those three gun stingers?

198
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,437
They don't come in real handy
when you need backup in fire fight.

199
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,774
I don't need backup with a gun
when I'm unbeatable with a sword.

200
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,110
Let's make one thing clear.

201
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:04,863
I got seniority
in this here arrangement.

202
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,782
I got at least 20 years on ya.

203
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:08,033
If we were alive.

204
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,619
But you have been dead
for three days.

205
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,204
Me?

206
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,873
162,425.

207
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:17,584
Or 445 years.

208
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:20,045
How senior do you feel now?

209
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,172
Hell with this. Hee-ya!

210
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,430
<i>I ain't gonna ask you again.</i>

211
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:34,226
I said, get in line.

212
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:35,894
Come on now, Daddy.

213
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,647
- No need to hurt me.
- I mean, us.

214
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,982
I'll get you all
what I have in the safe.

215
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:42,943
We ain't here for your money.

216
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,654
This is a bank.
What else do you want?

217
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:46,822
Them.

218
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:50,784
Yeah, we want people. You
got any of them in your safe?

219
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,536
'Cause, we'll take 'em all.
Oh!

220
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,414
I'm sorry about that.

221
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:58,542
You're the sorriest son-of-a-bitch
we ever had the misfortune

222
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,418
of getting stuck with.
The law is coming.

223
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,089
God damn, they brought
the whole cavalry this time.

224
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,383
You three stay here.
Hold them off.

225
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,135
Catch back up with us later.
Got it.

226
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,014
Damn it!

227
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,474
Hee-ya!

228
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,907
Oh.

229
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:22,792
You don't need a partner,

230
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,753
and I don't need
a stray dog, Roy.

231
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,546
Now let's go.

232
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,506
You're not gonna stop me
from seeing my daughter.

233
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,591
Now, listen.

234
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,095
That was unexpected.

235
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,390
You know,
I've never hit a woman.

236
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:40,101
But you come between me and my
Charlotte, there's gonna be hell to pay.

237
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,235
Faster than when
you were alive, huh?

238
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,897
I can't let you go see her.

239
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,107
Why not?

240
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:29,567
Because you...

241
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,655
...aren't you anymore.

242
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,640
So this is me now?

243
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,893
To everyone on Earth, anyway.

244
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,534
You always said I needed to be more
in touch with my feminine side, Millie.

245
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,202
If you could only see me now.

246
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:28,668
Breaks my heart, my daughter
will never know me again.

247
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:32,922
The RIPD gave you a second
chance to restore order to the world.

248
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,716
Not your old life.

249
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,260
That's why we don't return
as ourselves.

250
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,888
It would be too confusing
for anyone who knew us.

251
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:42,015
This is 1876 America.

252
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,850
If you haven't noticed,
folks around these parts

253
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,393
ain't too broad-minded.

254
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:48,355
Few people are gonna talk to
us, let alone even listen to us,

255
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,981
looking the way we do.

256
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:52,525
Why do that? Make our
job that much harder?

257
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:56,071
Maybe the eternal one thought
you could learn a thing or two.

258
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,365
Walking in shoes of those
deemed less advantaged.

259
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,450
Come on, now.
I have learned plenty.

260
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,993
My best friend is Black.

261
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,372
And my daughter is a woman.

262
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:07,082
Just because you know them,

263
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:10,043
does not mean you understand
what it's like to be them.

264
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,838
We'll say we're sisters.

265
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:15,131
Bounty hunters.

266
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,592
That should get us some respect.

267
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,262
I can't believe
that this here body

268
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:25,392
is right there, buried,
under my feet.

269
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:26,476
Well...

270
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:28,895
Well what?

271
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:32,148
It's true that part of you
was buried under there.

272
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,233
Part of me?

273
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,902
The parts they could find.
After you were shot.

274
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:39,948
I think buried here
is a foot, a shoulder,

275
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,742
your ear, maybe, and your...

276
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,412
My ass?
Yes.

277
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,288
They found your ass, too.

278
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:48,456
Where is the rest of me?

279
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,707
In a cave, apparently.

280
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,585
Some coyotes got to
you, Roy. Some coyotes?

281
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,963
They were hungry, and you
were dead. Hungry coyotes.

282
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,631
I heard they had
some small babies.

283
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:58,591
Small, hungry, baby coyotes.

284
00:20:58,675 --> 00:20:59,801
So, you helped them survive.

285
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,177
It's a beautiful thing,

286
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,012
to be a part of the
food chain. Shut up.

287
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,472
Circle of life...
Stop. Stop talking.

288
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:10,395
Where are you going, Roy?
My skin might have changed,

289
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,021
but my heart and soul
are still the same.

290
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,149
I know I can make
my daughter recognize me.

291
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:16,943
You can't communicate with
loved ones anymore either.

292
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,112
Anything you say to her

293
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,782
will only come out
as an incoherent gibberish.

294
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:27,537
So, not only will my daughter
not recognize me,

295
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,248
she won't understand a lick
of what I'm saying, either?

296
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:33,084
This is some bullshit.

297
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:39,632
I know exactly
how you feel, ma'am.

298
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:41,926
I understand your pain.

299
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:44,888
It's good to let it all out.

300
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,850
You've come to pay your respects
to the late Sheriff, too, then?

301
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:52,937
I can't say I've seen you
ladies around these parts before.

302
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:55,482
Do you know this man?
That is Henry.

303
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:56,941
My friend I was talking about.

304
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,359
We've known each other
since we were knee-high.

305
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:03,698
Name's Matilde, Father.

306
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:08,161
And this here is my
mute sister, Mabel.

307
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,915
We only met the Sheriff once.

308
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:15,126
He, uh, helped us
with our broken down wagon.

309
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,672
I must admit, I didn't take
much of a shine to him,

310
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:21,216
nor him to me.

311
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:25,220
In fact, he seemed quite
self-absorbed, if you ask me.

312
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:30,600
The kind of man that wanted to
control every situation he was in

313
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:34,521
no matter how out of
his depth he truly was.

314
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,732
But Mabel, well,

315
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:41,277
she seemed to think he
was something really special.

316
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:44,948
Well, we're all entitled to our
own points of view, I guess.

317
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:49,160
But I may have to side with
Miss Mabel over here on this one.

318
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:51,663
That man was special.

319
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:54,332
Far from perfect, of course.

320
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,751
But, special nonetheless.

321
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:59,754
I mean, was he a little
arrogant?

322
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,089
No doubt.

323
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,717
Did he think that
he had the answers

324
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,886
before the questions
were even asked?

325
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,098
That was Roy, to a tee.

326
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,517
Pigheaded? Ha!

327
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:16,062
Stubborn as an ornery mule,
more like it.

328
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,690
Boy, was Roy loyal.

329
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:24,612
To his family, this town, to me.

330
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:28,950
There is no one you wanted
more to have your back.

331
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,912
Makes me wonder how we're gonna
stand on our own two feet without him.

332
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,250
Especially against the evil likes
of them Samuels that did Roy in

333
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,586
and took poor
Charlotte's fiance,

334
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:41,796
amongst others.

335
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,215
Least they caught
three of them five reprobates

336
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:45,842
holding up a bank today.

337
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:49,095
Federal Marshals will be
transferring them to Laramie.

338
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:52,140
It's the hangman's noose
for them boys now.

339
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:54,851
Mmm-mmm. No, no. They
are moving them to Laramie.

340
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,604
They gotta pass through Snake
Gully and that's where we'll hit them.

341
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:58,813
No.

342
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,608
I have indulged
your little identity crisis.

343
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:03,610
But we must get to Red Creek.

344
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:05,194
Didn't you hear Henry?

345
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,238
The Samuels took Angus.

346
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:10,658
And that is an issue for the
Earthly authorities to solve,

347
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:11,951
not us.

348
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,995
Gateways, portals, deados.

349
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:16,539
That is your jurisdiction now,
Officer.

350
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:17,790
Out of my way.

351
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:22,045
The world could be at stake and
you care only about saving one man.

352
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:24,339
Not just any man.

353
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:27,967
The man that makes my daughter
the happiest in the world.

354
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,802
And for me,
my daughter is my world.

355
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:31,137
Was your world.

356
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,597
You are dead.

357
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,308
You'll get used to using
the past tense.

358
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:37,894
Hey, Jenny, would you go
walk around on my grave?

359
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,354
With pleasure.

360
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,481
Wait, why?

361
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,191
'Cause if you're gonna be
such a pain in my ass,

362
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:44,901
you might as well
be standing on it!

363
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,486
Goodbye, Mabel.

364
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,237
Take good care now.

365
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,323
Right. Mabel.

366
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:00,917
Settle down back there, boys.

367
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:03,503
Settle down.

368
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,845
Stubborn as an ornery mule.

369
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:15,223
Well, if that isn't
the understatement

370
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:17,850
of my many years
of after-life service.

371
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:19,977
How you feel about me is nothing

372
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:23,147
compared to my disposition
for those Samuel brothers.

373
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:26,234
<i>The damndest thing,
not too long ago,</i>

374
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:28,820
<i>those boys were good
and God-fearing.</i>

375
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:29,904
<i>Then just like that...</i>

376
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:32,490
<i>Bad. Turned.
Rotten to the core.</i>

377
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,117
<i>Old Doris Samuel said</i>

378
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,869
<i>her four boys
and adopted son, Slim,</i>

379
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:39,956
<i>went out to work an old well
one day on their farm,</i>

380
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,417
<i>and came back that night
a crazy bunch of no-goods.</i>

381
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,378
<i>She always said it was like,
they weren't her boys no more.</i>

382
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:49,507
Also, Henry said three of
the five Samuels were caught.

383
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,342
There should have been
only four left.

384
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:53,970
I pegged their leader, Zeke,
before I was killed.

385
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:57,181
Nobody could have
survived that shot.

386
00:25:57,849 --> 00:26:01,769
Maybe you're not the sharp shot
you thought you were, Annie Oakley.

387
00:26:01,853 --> 00:26:05,314
I can shoot the sting
off a hornet from 50 feet.

388
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:09,193
Your humility
is a virtue to behold.

389
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:10,486
Thank you.

390
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:13,030
Hoo!

391
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:14,115
Here they come.

392
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:17,034
Told you they'd pass this way.

393
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:18,202
Make it quick.

394
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:19,662
Now's our chance.

395
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:24,292
Go!

396
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:27,420
Don't you worry none, fellas.

397
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:29,756
We'll be getting you to that
judge soon enough.

398
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:34,510
Just your exploits in this region
alone will see you swinging by Sunday.

399
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:42,894
Sure you don't wanna go?

400
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:44,645
It's a great spot.

401
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:50,568
I feel light as a feather.

402
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:53,362
What are you doing? We
got the element of surprise!

403
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:54,447
Look.

404
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,282
Holy shit!

405
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,366
The Uroboros!

406
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,076
You may not be such
a bad shot after all, Roy.

407
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,496
But you couldn't have killed
that which was already dead.

408
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:05,958
Doris Samuels didn't think her sons
came home that night because they didn't.

409
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:09,837
Rogue souls that escaped judgement
must have been hiding in that well.

410
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:12,965
And possessed the brothers
and made them deados.

411
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:16,761
And this just
became our jurisdiction.

412
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:20,139
Help! Help me, misters!

413
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:21,557
Please.

414
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:23,851
It's my sister!

415
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:26,354
She's hurt real bad.

416
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:28,481
She's a bit slow, you see,

417
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,483
and doesn't have
a keen sense of direction.

418
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:34,862
Fact, she don't much have a keen
sense of anything at all right now,

419
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:35,947
truth be told.

420
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:38,449
She slipped from the top
of the canyon.

421
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:40,701
Banged herself up real good.

422
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,036
Now, you hold it right there.

423
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,372
We do not have the time
nor the disposition

424
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:45,957
to help the likes of you.

425
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,418
Guess you don't have
the disposition

426
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:52,421
for no Morgan silver
then neither.

427
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:54,841
Hey, fellas.

428
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:56,968
See if you can help
the little lady out.

429
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:04,016
Okay, then.

430
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,560
Thank you.

431
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:07,562
You're real saints.

432
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,509
Hey fellas, we gotta go.

433
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,429
Leave 'em to die if you have to.

434
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,390
Just make sure
you grab the silver.

435
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:48,519
Fellas?

436
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:57,111
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

437
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:21,844
Whoa!
I got her! I got her!

438
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:23,179
You go check!

439
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:30,269
Yeah, you got her.

440
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,271
That's for damn sure.

441
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:38,486
But I can't see no bullet hole.

442
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:41,405
Boo!

443
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,074
Hey, Marshal.

444
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:45,284
Still want that silver?

445
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:49,246
That's the thing about dying,
it can only happen once.

446
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,625
Ow. Just like a snake bite.

447
00:29:58,172 --> 00:30:00,007
Damn strong lock.

448
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:07,223
Search him again!

449
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,433
I'm telling you,
the key must have got lost

450
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:12,895
while you were busy assaulting
us US Federal Marshals.

451
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:18,275
No! These ain't mine!
Oh, God!

452
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,194
So what now?

453
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:25,491
We're gonna have
to pop one of them.

454
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:27,410
Pop what now?

455
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:30,162
Hmm?

456
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:33,290
You gonna partake in a little
moonshine with our captives?

457
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:34,875
This isn't moonshine.

458
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:38,504
But for deados,
something far more torturous.

459
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:19,086
Once popped,
he's got to be stopped.

460
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:30,014
What the...

461
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:38,981
Holy shit.

462
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,192
No, water.

463
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:42,902
Blessed by the Almighty.

464
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:46,822
Once they've possessed a human,
deados hate revealing their true selves.

465
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:48,824
The pain is unbearable.

466
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:51,368
Holy water speeds up
the process.

467
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:53,871
Uh, where are the other two?

468
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:55,998
Oh, there's one.

469
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,544
Like I said,

470
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:03,130
in a gunfight,
all I need is my sword.

471
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:05,299
Let's go, deado filth.

472
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:20,481
Son of a...

473
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:21,899
What?

474
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:24,860
What? Don't you
"what, what" me, boy.

475
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:27,279
You was the one that sent me
to the bone orchard

476
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:30,157
with a slug to the back
of the skull, ya damn coward!

477
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:32,535
Ma'am!
I've no idea who you are!

478
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,578
He doesn't recognize you,
Roycephus.

479
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:37,164
Roycephus?
Her name is Roycephus?

480
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:38,374
Oh!

481
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:39,959
I saw it on your tombstone.

482
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:41,919
It is a pretty funny name.
Is it Roman?

483
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:44,797
It means noble and kind!

484
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,924
Neither of which
I'm feeling at the moment,

485
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:49,176
as I stare into the eyes
of my murderer.

486
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,469
No! Whoa, whoa.
Slow down!

487
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:53,347
Now I know Sheriff Pulsipher
was shot near the train that day,

488
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,723
but I've no idea who did it.

489
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:55,850
You did it!

490
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:58,519
It was you! You shot
me from inside the train!

491
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:00,688
Nah, that bill
is a load of bosh.

492
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:01,814
Someone's trying to frame me!

493
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:03,357
Okay.

494
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,360
Cool, cool, so clearly,
you can't see our true selves.

495
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:08,028
But can you see these weapons?

496
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:09,196
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, I see them.

497
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,325
Good, 'cause this pistol is the
last thing you're ever gonna see!

498
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:14,702
<i>Adios,</i> deados!

499
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:17,121
No. What about
getting him to talk?

500
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,748
Think about your daughter.
About Angus.

501
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:21,500
They're the reason
we're here, right?

502
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:23,711
God damn it!

503
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:29,300
What did you do with
the people from the train?

504
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:30,384
Eat a horn toad!

505
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:31,760
Ah...

506
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:35,931
Oh, boy.
Mmm-hmm.

507
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,577
Come on out!

508
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,995
Any more, and he'll pop.

509
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:00,122
I'll talk. Please!

510
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:12,509
Go on, then. Talk.

511
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:15,471
Okay. Okay, okay.
There's this deado.

512
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:18,182
The worst I've ever seen.
Goes by the name Otis.

513
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:21,977
Otis Claiborne.
And he ain't like most deados.

514
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:23,479
He's more powerful.

515
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:26,690
He forced me and the souls
that took over the other Samuels

516
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:29,777
to kidnap people
and deliver them to Red Creek.

517
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,488
Red Creek? As in
Red Creek, Utah?

518
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:33,822
Yeah.

519
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:37,952
Maybe this little diversion
wasn't a waste of time, after all.

520
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,413
And how long you been
rounding up folks for this Otis'?

521
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:43,958
About a month.
Since he showed up.

522
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:46,794
That's around the same time
as the gateway rupture.

523
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:51,006
You reckon this Otis could be the
"hellish discharge" Hano was on about?

524
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,259
Souls can escape
on their way into Hell

525
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:55,344
but none have ever
gotten back out.

526
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:58,264
What business does this Otis
have with the kidnapped folk?

527
00:34:58,347 --> 00:35:00,349
He's locking them up.
Keeping them healthy.

528
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,726
He's got something
big planned. That's for sure.

529
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:05,312
And it's goin' down soon.
That's all I know!

530
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:07,273
Means Angus
might still be alive.

531
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:11,527
Look, we was just trying
to lay low from you RIPD.

532
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:15,406
But Otis has a real
scary way about him.

533
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:17,408
I ain't proud of what I done,

534
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:20,953
but he threatened to wipe
us all out if we didn't help.

535
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,580
And how exactly
was he going to do that?

536
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:25,958
Deados can't wipe out
other deados.

537
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:29,586
With one of those, they can.

538
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:35,050
Now why would this Otis fella
have himself an RIPD equalizer?

539
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:38,262
I don't know.
But it's not good.

540
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:40,723
We need to get to Red Creek.

541
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:42,641
Ow!

542
00:36:15,758 --> 00:36:18,260
That deado crew has returned.

543
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:21,055
But they only brought back
eight more.

544
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:26,685
I'll get them to do one
last run before midnight.

545
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:30,481
Their leader said they're
done. For good this time.

546
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:34,151
Seems they want out before
any RIPD start moving in.

547
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,111
Is that so?

548
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,239
What else did he say?

549
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:42,743
He doesn't think we should all
be following you with such...

550
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:44,620
...blind faith.

551
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:47,498
They are questioning
your origins.

552
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,958
Who you say you really are.

553
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,252
And you?

554
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:55,089
Do you doubt who I say I am?

555
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,384
It's just...

556
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:02,096
They're questioning
how you got out.

557
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:23,575
As one of the three,
I had the freedom

558
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:25,744
to roam all circles
of the underworld.

559
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:29,998
I escaped through limbo
during that full moon eclipse

560
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:32,334
when a fragment of
the gateway grew weak.

561
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:38,132
Now, tonight's blood moon
completes a tetradic lunar cycle,

562
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:42,177
making the entire gateway
weak and vulnerable at midnight.

563
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,433
That's when we put
the humans to work.

564
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:50,686
It gives them six hours to toil

565
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,272
until the gateway strengthens
again at dawn,

566
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:56,567
making it impossible
to penetrate once more.

567
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:01,113
This is why we need
as many hands as we can get.

568
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,074
Because if they fail...

569
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,869
...it will be another
quarter of a century

570
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:10,164
before the gateway
is at its weakest once again.

571
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:16,962
I was tired of fighting
for control down below.

572
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:21,341
I escaped to rule over my
own dominion here on Earth.

573
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:24,803
I can barely wait a few hours,
let alone a quarter of a century.

574
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:28,765
Now you tell me.

575
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:34,813
Do I also have to fight for
your belief in me as well?

576
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,191
No, I'm with you.

577
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:39,526
I am.

578
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,362
I believe you can deliver us
Hell on Earth.

579
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,072
But...

580
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:45,324
But what?

581
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:48,118
I can no longer speak
for the others.

582
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:52,623
Well, let's go open
everyone's eyes, then.

583
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,584
If you're gonna put faith in me,

584
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,753
I no longer want it to be blind.

585
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,006
Hmm.

586
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,518
Are you sure we can't just pop this
dead weight? He's holding us back.

587
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:15,145
Execution is not RIPD policy.

588
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:17,773
Once we're done, Hano will
have him redirected back to Hell.

589
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,566
His fate has already
been sealed.

590
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,528
Just put me on the back
of the horse, Miss Horciphus.

591
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:24,112
We'll get there much quicker.

592
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:26,490
I'll hold on to you
real tight. I promise.

593
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:31,119
We'll keep each other nice and
toasty, huh? What do you say?

594
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,164
I'll give him a fighting
chance. Ten seconds start.

595
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:35,874
He did kill me, after all.

596
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:39,336
"The best revenge is to be
unlike him who caused the injury."

597
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:41,672
You quoting the Bible on me now?

598
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:44,049
No.
Marcus Aurelius said that.

599
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,468
Like you, he was a Roman, too.

600
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:49,763
Roycephus ain't Roman.
It's a family name.

601
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:52,599
Okay. I got it.
Message received.

602
00:39:52,683 --> 00:39:55,769
Don't you mean "Roy-ceiphed"?
Message "Roy-ceiphed."

603
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:58,939
Get it? 'Cause your
name is Royceph...

604
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,901
Oh! Here come the snake bites.
Snake what?

605
00:40:02,985 --> 00:40:05,070
Ow! Ow!

606
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:08,282
I'm sorry, okay? Damn!

607
00:40:11,702 --> 00:40:14,496
I'm gonna file a complaint
when you take me in.

608
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,417
Speaking of fate,
I gotta thank you.

609
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:23,213
For, uh, saving my life
back at the canyon.

610
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:25,674
He had me dead to rights.

611
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:28,635
That wasn't easy for you,
was it?

612
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:31,972
Admitting you can't do it alone.

613
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:34,391
I'm not admitting anything, I'm just
saying thanks for having my back.

614
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:35,475
Don't make this awkward.

615
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:36,560
You're welcome.

616
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,645
But it wasn't your life
that I saved back there.

617
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,565
But something
far more important.

618
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:43,859
Your soul.

619
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,822
So tell me,
your dearly departed Millie,

620
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:50,991
do you think she ended
"up" or "down"?

621
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:54,161
Well seeing how I was
heading to the pearly gates,

622
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:57,831
that damn fine woman probably
has a seat in the front row.

623
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:58,957
Hmm.

624
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,667
Looking forward to joining her.

625
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:04,087
Hopefully,
she is waiting for you.

626
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:07,257
Oh, hey!

627
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:11,178
What's that now?
Oh, nothing.

628
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:13,764
It's just...
It's just what?

629
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:17,726
It's just there are
a lot of good men in heaven.

630
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:18,935
Very good men.

631
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:21,688
Good looking, so I hear.

632
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,399
Maybe she moved on.

633
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:26,109
They can do that?

634
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:27,235
Yeah.

635
00:41:28,362 --> 00:41:29,905
Damn!

636
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:35,118
I thought when I died,

637
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:38,288
Millie and I would be
together for eternity.

638
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:41,041
Eternity?
Together with you, Roy?

639
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:42,834
No, no, no, no.

640
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:46,380
That would be more like Hell
for poor Millie. Don't you think?

641
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:47,881
Yeah, it would. It would.

642
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:50,759
What are you laughing at?
What?

643
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,969
I'm just breaking your <i>noix.</i>

644
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:54,054
Breaking my what?

645
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:55,972
Your, uh, this, only for boys.

646
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:57,933
Breaking my nuts?
Yes.

647
00:41:58,058 --> 00:42:00,102
You were breaking
my nuts? Uh-huh.

648
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:02,688
That was a good one.
Yes!

649
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:03,897
Oh, you got me.

650
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,023
I got you.
Yeah.

651
00:42:05,107 --> 00:42:07,067
You got me, too.
Man, she's funny.

652
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,152
Weird, but funny.

653
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:11,446
I'll shut up now.
Message Roy-ceiphed.

654
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:14,533
I mean received. Aw, shit.

655
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:17,202
Ow!

656
00:42:47,858 --> 00:42:50,277
I heard this was all
you could muster.

657
00:42:51,153 --> 00:42:53,447
Word's getting around
about our kidnappings,

658
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,949
so it's rare to find anybody
gathering around here at all.

659
00:42:57,409 --> 00:43:00,036
Our last two scores
had to be over the border.

660
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:03,915
Like I said,
we're done here now.

661
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:14,176
You really don't wanna stay
and be a part of the foundation

662
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:16,136
that creates a new world order?

663
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:21,183
You don't wanna witness
something truly biblical?

664
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:35,113
What a shame
you have no faith in me.

665
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:38,992
Because when I lead our kind
in Earth's great takeover,

666
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:43,038
you could have had
a seat at the main table.

667
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:00,388
Look at me!

668
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:02,015
Open your eyes.

669
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:05,477
I said, open your eyes!

670
00:44:10,232 --> 00:44:11,817
And believe!

671
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,332
How do you feel about staying?

672
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:31,837
Go help the others.

673
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:37,175
I want these new ones
masked up, watered and fed.

674
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:39,803
I need them all fit
for the work ahead.

675
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,491
You think anyone
doubts who I am now?

676
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:11,418
Let's play a game called
"When we were alive."

677
00:45:12,252 --> 00:45:15,630
So, when you were alive,
what'd you prefer?

678
00:45:15,714 --> 00:45:18,383
Whiskey or gin?

679
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:20,385
Dresses or tights?

680
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,137
Chicken or steak?

681
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:24,347
You know what to do.

682
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,057
Come again?

683
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:32,314
Ow!

684
00:45:33,273 --> 00:45:35,567
It's actually
starting to tickle.

685
00:45:35,692 --> 00:45:36,693
Damn it!

686
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:39,905
The waltz or tango?

687
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:43,533
Coffee or tea?

688
00:45:43,617 --> 00:45:45,577
Saloons or brothels?

689
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,997
Sunrise or sunset?

690
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,417
Long hair, short hair?

691
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,544
Missionary or doggy-style?

692
00:45:54,628 --> 00:45:56,421
Oh! Ah!

693
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:58,173
I'm starting to like that.

694
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:00,342
Are we there yet?

695
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:05,972
"The sun
will turn into darkness,

696
00:46:06,056 --> 00:46:07,265
"and the moon into blood,

697
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:09,351
"before the great
and terrible day comes."

698
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:11,478
Guessing that's not
Marcus Aurelius?

699
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:12,771
The <i>Book of Joel.</i>

700
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:15,565
The sentiment is echoed in
Acts and Revelations, signifying...

701
00:46:15,649 --> 00:46:16,900
The beginning
of the end of times?

702
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:19,903
Yeah, Hano sent me back to
Earth with that same cheery note.

703
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:21,947
Just over that ridge
is Red Creek.

704
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:24,658
I'd turn back if I were you.

705
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:27,869
Here are the rules.

706
00:46:27,953 --> 00:46:31,831
You open that rancid pie hole of yours
and you tell anyone who we really are,

707
00:46:31,915 --> 00:46:33,959
you eat one of these
bullets. Mmm-hmm.

708
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:37,253
You even imply
that we're RIPD...

709
00:46:37,337 --> 00:46:38,838
You eat one of these
here bullets.

710
00:46:38,964 --> 00:46:45,095
In fact you speak without me
allowing you to speak...

711
00:46:45,178 --> 00:46:46,805
I eat one of them there bullets?

712
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:49,015
You're not as dumb as you look.

713
00:46:56,356 --> 00:46:58,817
You so damn ugly.

714
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:01,277
Good idea.

715
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:03,488
We don't want anyone
recognizing we have him.

716
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:05,991
Yeah. That's why I did it.

717
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:09,619
What's that smell?

718
00:47:25,844 --> 00:47:28,763
Two Black women are pulling
a hooded man through town

719
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:30,724
with a rope and no one
bats an eyelid?

720
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:36,855
They seem too ill
to notice anything.

721
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:38,606
Yeah, I wonder
what's ailing them.

722
00:47:39,441 --> 00:47:41,651
Cholera hit Blackpool
a few months back.

723
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:50,869
You hear that?

724
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:54,164
I hear nothing.
Exactly.

725
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:58,168
Just when you think things
couldn't get any stranger...

726
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:03,798
An empty saloon. Whatever
happened here, happened in a hurry.

727
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:08,845
Boys, where is everyone?

728
00:48:12,766 --> 00:48:14,726
That's right! Pile it all up.

729
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:17,228
Come on, keep it moving now.
Come on. There you go.

730
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:20,148
All your donations are
going to a damn fine cause,

731
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,399
I assure you, so...

732
00:48:21,483 --> 00:48:23,818
Keep those heads up and
have another blessed eve...

733
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:25,779
Who's the snake oil salesman?
...in the good Lord's favorite town!

734
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,200
Ah, Julius Butterfield.
He owns the saloon,

735
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:33,828
livery stables, general store, the
local printing press and the hotel.

736
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,914
Oh, yeah.
He's also the mayor.

737
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:37,248
Seems like a fair election.

738
00:48:42,879 --> 00:48:45,507
- Okay, I got you.
- I got you.

739
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,051
Forgive my tardiness.

740
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:51,221
There are days I need at least
five of me to get all I need...

741
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:53,389
...done.

742
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:57,393
Oh, no, no, no.

743
00:48:57,477 --> 00:48:58,520
You...

744
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:00,897
You're gonna have to leave.
You should not be in here.

745
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,482
Sure, we should!

746
00:49:03,525 --> 00:49:05,110
We're bounty hunters.

747
00:49:05,235 --> 00:49:08,696
Sisters. All the way
from Bandera, Texas.

748
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:12,617
We require lodgings.
And this is a hotel.

749
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:14,786
He your bounty then?

750
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:17,872
You're not as dumb as you look.

751
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:20,458
Well, maybe you both are...

752
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:23,044
...because it appears
that you can't read.

753
00:49:26,756 --> 00:49:27,924
Now leave.

754
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:29,926
You're breaking the law.

755
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:32,846
Just 'cause it's a law,
don't make it right.

756
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:35,014
I'm gonna ask you
to take that down.

757
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:38,643
Just as soon
as I get that chance.

758
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:49,654
Burn it.

759
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:52,490
You don't tell me what to do.

760
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:56,953
Now.

761
00:49:59,164 --> 00:50:00,165
Right.

762
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:02,709
You're right.

763
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:05,712
Capitalism is colorblind.

764
00:50:05,795 --> 00:50:08,298
And being more open means
making more money, after all.

765
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:09,465
So...

766
00:50:09,549 --> 00:50:10,550
Thank you.

767
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:13,469
All right.

768
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:33,823
You all right?

769
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:46,252
Beverly!

770
00:50:50,215 --> 00:50:51,216
Yes, sir!

771
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:55,011
What's all that "sir" nonsense?

772
00:50:55,345 --> 00:50:58,973
I told you it's just plain old
"Julius" to you and everyone else.

773
00:50:59,057 --> 00:51:01,184
We're all one and the same
around here.

774
00:51:02,894 --> 00:51:05,563
Now, Beverly would you
please be so kind

775
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:09,400
as to show our guests here
to room 5?

776
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:13,988
Thank you.

777
00:51:15,323 --> 00:51:16,574
Enjoy your stay.

778
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:20,787
Follow me, ladies.

779
00:51:26,209 --> 00:51:30,672
Pardon my asking, but I recognize
the birthmark on the arm of your bounty.

780
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:33,841
He and his posse have been in
and out of town a few times of late.

781
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:35,718
Mind if I enquire
what you got him for?

782
00:51:35,802 --> 00:51:37,345
Killing a US Marshal.

783
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:40,181
I told you, I ain't kill no...

784
00:51:40,265 --> 00:51:41,933
But don't you worry none,
Miss Beverly.

785
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:43,851
We're gonna keep a
real close eye on him.

786
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:45,561
I ain't afraid of him.

787
00:51:45,645 --> 00:51:49,983
His partners were plain nasty.
But he was, uh, nice.

788
00:51:50,066 --> 00:51:51,234
Yes, thank you.

789
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:52,485
Come on in.

790
00:51:57,407 --> 00:51:59,617
I hope it has everything
you need.

791
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:05,707
Excuse my own inquisitiveness,

792
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:08,251
Miss Beverly,

793
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:12,088
but what ails the town?

794
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:14,882
Oh...

795
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:17,885
No one knows for sure.

796
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:20,096
Started about a month ago.

797
00:52:20,722 --> 00:52:23,766
Mr. Butterfield says it has
to do with the water supply.

798
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:26,519
But between you and me
and the bedpost,

799
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:29,897
I think that's just a ploy
for him to sell more whiskey.

800
00:52:30,315 --> 00:52:31,607
To who?

801
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:33,318
There ain't barely
anyone around.

802
00:52:33,526 --> 00:52:36,612
Oh. Town emptied out
dead of last night.

803
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:40,658
Mr. Butterfield says gold
was struck not far away.

804
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:44,996
Seems everyone must want a
piece before there's nothing left.

805
00:52:46,331 --> 00:52:49,083
If that was the case, I reckon old
Butterfield would have been the first

806
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:50,418
to break ground.

807
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:52,879
Do you really believe him?

808
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:56,174
I don't have much of a choice.

809
00:52:57,175 --> 00:52:58,176
Pardon me.

810
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:03,473
I suggest you keep
your door locked.

811
00:53:07,268 --> 00:53:09,395
You heard her.
She said I'm nice.

812
00:53:09,479 --> 00:53:10,938
She ain't well.

813
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:12,774
Confusing you with someone else.

814
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:15,151
I mean, can a deado be nice?

815
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,195
Not in my extended experience.

816
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:19,739
Well, look who's
discriminating now.

817
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:22,992
There must be something in
the air making everybody sick.

818
00:53:23,076 --> 00:53:26,371
That's why it's not affecting any
of us. In other words, the dead.

819
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:28,081
And I think...

820
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:32,043
It's coming from up there.

821
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:33,294
Hmm? Up where?

822
00:53:42,804 --> 00:53:44,555
Daddy! Daddy!

823
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,229
Stay with me!
Stay with me!

824
00:53:53,481 --> 00:53:55,233
Don't, don't!
Don't, don't!

825
00:53:55,316 --> 00:53:57,527
Please! I've got
to revive my daddy.

826
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,529
Please...
No, no, no.

827
00:54:00,655 --> 00:54:03,866
Look, he's still with us.
Just let him rest.

828
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:08,287
Listen, lady. Up here, if you
take off that mask, you will die.

829
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:09,539
And fast.

830
00:54:09,622 --> 00:54:11,040
How do you know?

831
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:13,918
I've seen it happen.

832
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:34,897
Okay! Stop it!
You've made your point.

833
00:54:36,399 --> 00:54:37,525
Okay!

834
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:51,330
What do they want with us all?

835
00:54:51,831 --> 00:54:52,832
I don't know.

836
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:56,002
I have a feeling that we'll
come to understand real soon.

837
00:54:56,586 --> 00:54:58,296
What are you looking at?

838
00:55:36,751 --> 00:55:37,877
God damn it!

839
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:45,301
You gotta get all the
equipment up to the mine.

840
00:55:46,177 --> 00:55:47,720
There's no time to waste.

841
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:50,723
We start opening the gateway
in less than an hour.

842
00:55:57,647 --> 00:55:59,148
What do you want, Butterfield?

843
00:55:59,232 --> 00:56:01,234
Listen. Otis.

844
00:56:01,317 --> 00:56:03,736
I've done everything asked
of me so far, haven't I?

845
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:07,657
You did try and run away from
me a few days ago, remember?

846
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,451
Okay, okay, but since then,

847
00:56:10,535 --> 00:56:13,037
I couldn't have been more
accommodating to your needs,

848
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,249
no matter how felonious
or demanding.

849
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:19,043
But, please.

850
00:56:19,377 --> 00:56:20,795
I'm begging you.

851
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:24,173
All I want in return
is one of these.

852
00:56:28,344 --> 00:56:30,221
I told you they're
for workers only.

853
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:33,474
Are you gonna be one?

854
00:56:33,558 --> 00:56:35,726
I told you, I got a town to run.

855
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:37,395
You don't have much of one left.

856
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:38,980
Because you've taken everyone!

857
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:40,439
No! Please!

858
00:56:44,944 --> 00:56:46,362
No, no, no. Please.

859
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:50,366
Please! A couple of healthy
ones just checked into the hotel.

860
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:51,951
Take them, too.

861
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:54,245
Just give me a mask.

862
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:56,831
I don't wanna die.

863
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:59,417
Death is not so bad.

864
00:57:01,294 --> 00:57:06,007
In fact, sometimes it's the
beginning of a whole new kind of life.

865
00:57:06,716 --> 00:57:08,092
I mean, look at us,

866
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:13,347
we can breathe all kinds of toxic
air that you can't in your current form.

867
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:23,983
And didn't I promise your body
the same sort of rebirth

868
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:28,404
if you just showed us a little
cooperation and hospitality?

869
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:29,655
And I have.

870
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:31,907
I've done everything.

871
00:57:31,991 --> 00:57:34,910
I just... I just want
my town back.

872
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:39,540
Tomorrow is the dawn
of a new day for you.

873
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:44,462
And all mankind.

874
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:47,006
Go on.

875
00:57:47,298 --> 00:57:48,299
Take it.

876
00:57:50,051 --> 00:57:51,260
It's yours.

877
00:58:05,775 --> 00:58:08,152
What are you all even doing
up that mountain anyways?

878
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:12,782
Well now that you have that
mask on, you're gonna find out.

879
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:17,828
Otis, please!

880
00:58:18,788 --> 00:58:19,872
Otis!

881
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:21,916
- Otis!
- Get back.

882
00:58:24,627 --> 00:58:27,922
Ugh. Damn! Smelt like a
horse's ding-dong under there

883
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,048
You would know. Where is...

884
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:31,425
...Otis keeping
the kidnappees?

885
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:33,928
We delivered them to the
church. That's all I know. Promise.

886
00:58:35,888 --> 00:58:38,015
Ow. What are you doing?
I can help!

887
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:40,226
Nice try hoss.
You're staying put.

888
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:42,395
You got looser lips
than a jaw less mule.

889
00:58:42,478 --> 00:58:44,188
You're gonna stay right here.

890
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:45,356
Come on!

891
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:48,651
That is tight as a bull's ass
in fly season.

892
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:51,570
Look, give me a chance
to prove myself!

893
00:58:51,654 --> 00:58:53,739
Please. I don't wanna
go to Hell.

894
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:55,825
Nothing we can do
about that now.

895
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:58,869
I didn't do nothing that bad
when I was alive.

896
00:58:58,953 --> 00:59:00,413
Clearly, you did enough.

897
00:59:00,496 --> 00:59:03,416
I mean, I stole some stuff.

898
00:59:03,499 --> 00:59:04,583
Just some?

899
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:06,544
Okay, a little more than some.

900
00:59:08,337 --> 00:59:10,172
A lot. I stole a lot of stuff.

901
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:11,716
In fact, I was called "Bumble,"

902
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:14,510
on account of my hands were
stickier than a beehive. See?

903
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:17,805
Hey! That's my new Susie!

904
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:22,101
You call your gun "Susie"?

905
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:25,062
Yeah, named it after
my dear old Meemaw.

906
00:59:25,146 --> 00:59:28,190
You named a soul killer after your
grandma and I'm the twisted one?

907
00:59:28,274 --> 00:59:31,110
You should be going to Hell,
not... My point is,

908
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:33,904
I could have blown both
your souls to dust just now.

909
00:59:33,988 --> 00:59:35,156
But I didn't.

910
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:38,951
'Cause I want you to know
you can trust me.

911
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:42,371
Stealing ain't right,
I know that.

912
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:44,623
But it ain't nothing
compared to them souls

913
00:59:44,707 --> 00:59:46,584
that took over
the other Samuel boys.

914
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:50,296
You heard Beverly, them deados
are meaner than cut snakes.

915
00:59:50,379 --> 00:59:51,797
And I ain't like them.

916
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:56,844
You think it's fair that we all get judged
to end up in the same awful place?

917
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:05,478
Psst, psst.

918
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:07,605
What is it?

919
01:00:07,688 --> 01:00:10,274
Is there a chance that
old Slim, the real Slim,

920
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:12,485
a little part of him
is still in there?

921
01:00:12,568 --> 01:00:15,070
No. Slim is long gone.

922
01:00:15,154 --> 01:00:17,698
This "Bumble" soul
is in complete control now.

923
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:19,575
And he's playing you, Roy.

924
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:22,953
Deados will do anything
to avoid going to Hell.

925
01:00:23,746 --> 01:00:24,997
Don't be fooled.

926
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:26,957
Now let's go.

927
01:00:30,586 --> 01:00:33,047
I don't wanna go to
Hell. I don't belong there!

928
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:36,217
Please! Let me prove it to
you. I can prove it to you, please.

929
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,761
- I said, let's go, Roy.
- Please!

930
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:43,307
Please! Please come back!

931
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:45,893
I don't wanna go to Hell!

932
01:00:47,353 --> 01:00:49,980
Please! I don't belong there!

933
01:00:59,824 --> 01:01:02,660
God have mercy on their souls.

934
01:01:05,246 --> 01:01:06,247
Sorry.

935
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:09,917
The desecration of a house
of God is the ultimate sin.

936
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,168
Ultimate?

937
01:01:11,252 --> 01:01:15,756
Kidnapping, hurting children, murder,
tad bit higher, but to each their own.

938
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:19,969
At least we know
Slim was telling the truth.

939
01:01:20,052 --> 01:01:22,930
Angus was here. He was wearing
this the day he was taken.

940
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:25,558
Help me somebody!

941
01:01:25,933 --> 01:01:28,811
Help me, please! Anybody!

942
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:32,273
Is anybody there? Please!
Anybody, help...

943
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:34,358
Butterfield?

944
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:39,530
What the hell
are you doing in there?

945
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:41,574
This guy Otis
and his bunch of madmen!

946
01:01:41,657 --> 01:01:43,117
They've seized my entire town,

947
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,411
just rode right in here, threw
me in the back of this van...

948
01:01:45,494 --> 01:01:47,413
Slow down! Where'd
they take everyone?

949
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:49,039
Up the mountain.

950
01:01:49,874 --> 01:01:51,792
But the only thing up
there IS an old mine.

951
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:53,836
Ain't no one struck it lucky
up there for...

952
01:01:53,919 --> 01:01:55,087
The gateway!
Yeah.

953
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:58,632
I did hear Otis say something
about "opening a gateway."

954
01:01:58,716 --> 01:02:01,927
The poisonous gas in the air
is seeping through the gateway

955
01:02:02,011 --> 01:02:03,762
from the depths of Hell.

956
01:02:03,846 --> 01:02:06,557
That rupture
was Otis's soul escaping.

957
01:02:08,517 --> 01:02:10,603
Oh, Lord.
Why are you praying?

958
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:15,608
Otis is going to use the humans
to crack the whole thing wide open.

959
01:02:15,691 --> 01:02:17,735
Why, so he can
get back inside? No.

960
01:02:17,818 --> 01:02:20,321
So he can let the souls
of the damned back out.

961
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:22,448
Roy.
Roy?

962
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:25,993
Otis is going to use those digging
humans and turn them into deados.

963
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:28,829
After that,
they'll keep pouring out,

964
01:02:28,913 --> 01:02:31,123
eventually taking over and...

965
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:33,334
Possessing the rest
of the world.

966
01:02:33,876 --> 01:02:35,920
I get it. End of times.

967
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:37,838
Mmm-hmm.

968
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:41,383
But why doesn't Otis and his deado
troop just do the digging themselves?

969
01:02:41,467 --> 01:02:44,595
Like us, they're unaffected by the gas
and stronger than the humans, right?

970
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:50,184
God created a defense, a kind
of buffer between Earth and Hell

971
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:52,353
to stop the souls beneath
from returning.

972
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:55,439
That buffer was all of humanity.

973
01:02:55,940 --> 01:03:00,402
Only when they invite the souls
back in are they able to rise again.

974
01:03:00,486 --> 01:03:01,737
But that would never happen.

975
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:05,282
'Cause mankind would never
welcome pure evil back into their world.

976
01:03:05,366 --> 01:03:07,493
But by digging
through the gateway,

977
01:03:08,661 --> 01:03:10,287
that's exactly
what they're doing.

978
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:22,841
Okay, you just lost me with all
that talk of Hell and "souls escaping."

979
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:26,512
You women can be
so overly dramatic.

980
01:03:26,595 --> 01:03:29,974
Really? Well, clearly
you don't want "us women"...

981
01:03:30,057 --> 01:03:31,725
...to save your ass?

982
01:03:32,601 --> 01:03:34,311
No!
No?

983
01:03:34,395 --> 01:03:35,437
Fine, just do it yourself!

984
01:03:46,532 --> 01:03:47,533
A little help!

985
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:56,875
A little help!

986
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:00,713
A little more help!
I'm trying.

987
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:04,925
Here! Take it.

988
01:04:35,706 --> 01:04:37,207
Mr. Butterfield!

989
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,502
I have your tea
and nightcap for you.

990
01:04:43,589 --> 01:04:44,882
Mr. Butterfield, sir?

991
01:05:37,017 --> 01:05:39,311
"Butterfield Printing Press"?

992
01:05:39,812 --> 01:05:41,063
"500 copies"?

993
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:08,215
You didn't kill no lawman.

994
01:06:09,216 --> 01:06:11,468
You're a victim
of a gross injustice.

995
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:16,640
No way.

996
01:06:17,766 --> 01:06:18,767
Now go.

997
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:20,727
Before they come back.

998
01:06:21,061 --> 01:06:22,062
Go!

999
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:44,626
I think I'm dying.

1000
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,006
I know something that may help.

1001
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:00,726
Get these to the folks
who are still around.

1002
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:02,186
Can you help me?

1003
01:07:02,269 --> 01:07:04,688
I've got someplace else
I need to be.

1004
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,127
- You guys ready?
- Yeah. All set, ma'am.

1005
01:07:27,211 --> 01:07:28,337
It's almost midnight.

1006
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,425
Not much longer now.

1007
01:07:35,302 --> 01:07:36,511
Hey, hey!

1008
01:07:36,595 --> 01:07:37,846
Back from the door!

1009
01:07:41,475 --> 01:07:42,476
Hey.

1010
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:45,103
I know that sword.

1011
01:07:46,063 --> 01:07:49,149
Yeah. We bagged
ourselves some RIPD.

1012
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:07,376
Don't take your eyes off them.

1013
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:12,506
It looked like she recognized
you and could see me.

1014
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:17,177
Yup. Now we know where those
deados got their RIPD weapons.

1015
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:19,012
That's Nell Boyce.

1016
01:08:19,096 --> 01:08:21,473
Recruitment got
that one all wrong.

1017
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:23,850
She robbed our armory
before going into hiding.

1018
01:08:23,934 --> 01:08:25,644
Guess she found something
worth coming out for.

1019
01:09:03,849 --> 01:09:06,018
You got some stones on you, boy.

1020
01:09:06,101 --> 01:09:09,396
But sometimes, saving
the day requires you to admit

1021
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,023
you can't do it alone.

1022
01:09:11,732 --> 01:09:12,733
Whoa.

1023
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:16,028
You should better
get some masks.

1024
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:18,739
You're gonna croak real
fast up in here if you don't.

1025
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,283
Angus?

1026
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:24,202
I'm sorry, do I know you, ma'am?

1027
01:09:24,286 --> 01:09:25,704
Of course you do, son.
It's me...

1028
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:27,414
Ro...

1029
01:09:28,457 --> 01:09:29,458
Right.

1030
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:32,669
No, uh...

1031
01:09:33,879 --> 01:09:35,881
No, you, uh, don't know me.

1032
01:09:35,964 --> 01:09:37,257
No, um...

1033
01:09:37,341 --> 01:09:39,885
I, uh, just heard...

1034
01:09:39,968 --> 01:09:42,387
...your name
called out by somebody

1035
01:09:42,471 --> 01:09:45,265
when you were storming
out of the cage

1036
01:09:45,349 --> 01:09:47,351
like a wild mustang.

1037
01:09:47,434 --> 01:09:49,102
"Careful, Angus!

1038
01:09:49,186 --> 01:09:51,813
"Don't do anything foolish,
Angus. And so on."

1039
01:09:51,897 --> 01:09:53,940
That doesn't matter right
now. What matters is...

1040
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:56,610
...I see you now.

1041
01:09:56,693 --> 01:10:00,155
And you got much more moxie
than I ever gave you credit for.

1042
01:10:02,449 --> 01:10:06,161
I've been wrong to judge you
unkindly since we met.

1043
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:10,332
Which was, what,
maybe a minute ago?

1044
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:11,833
Miss...

1045
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:13,460
Mabel.

1046
01:10:14,169 --> 01:10:15,504
The name's Mabel.

1047
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:18,173
Are you married, Angus?

1048
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:20,217
No, ma'am.

1049
01:10:21,468 --> 01:10:22,469
But I'm engaged.

1050
01:10:23,428 --> 01:10:25,972
To the most wondrous human
that I've ever met.

1051
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:27,516
And her father?

1052
01:10:27,599 --> 01:10:29,267
Handsome son of a bitch,
ain't he?

1053
01:10:29,351 --> 01:10:31,686
What?
I mean... I guess?

1054
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:33,397
Not a guessing game,
I'm sure he is.

1055
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:39,152
You know, I just never understood
why he never took a shine to me.

1056
01:10:39,236 --> 01:10:45,283
Maybe he stupidly thought that
you marrying my... His daughter...

1057
01:10:45,367 --> 01:10:47,285
...you were trying
to replace him.

1058
01:10:47,953 --> 01:10:48,954
And you know...

1059
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:54,418
What, with his poor wife taken
ill by the pox a few years earlier...

1060
01:10:55,961 --> 01:11:00,715
...maybe he was scared
he'd be left all alone.

1061
01:11:01,049 --> 01:11:02,050
Wow.

1062
01:11:03,635 --> 01:11:06,680
How could you possibly
know all that?

1063
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:09,307
It's a gift.

1064
01:11:10,976 --> 01:11:13,478
Some call it women's intuition.

1065
01:11:13,562 --> 01:11:15,230
Let me ask you something.

1066
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:19,484
If he was standing right here, right
now, what would you say to him?

1067
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:23,447
Well, I would say, "Roy..."

1068
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:24,781
"You handsome son-of-a-bitch,"

1069
01:11:24,865 --> 01:11:27,075
start with flattery,
helps with future in-laws.

1070
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:29,744
Um...
So I'd say, "Roy...

1071
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:35,208
"not only do I think
that you are...

1072
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:39,504
A handsome son-of-a-bitch."
...a handsome son-of-a-bitch, but...

1073
01:11:39,588 --> 01:11:43,508
"I just want you to know that I
could never compete with you.

1074
01:11:43,592 --> 01:11:46,887
"And I just hope you know
how much I respect you.

1075
01:11:48,847 --> 01:11:51,475
"If I can ever be half the
husband for my Charlotte

1076
01:11:51,558 --> 01:11:53,643
"that you've been
a father, then I...

1077
01:11:53,727 --> 01:11:56,146
"I'll die knowing
that I got it right."

1078
01:11:59,608 --> 01:12:02,402
You're gonna get that chance,
I promise you.

1079
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:07,991
For inspiration.

1080
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:13,330
I told you, I got a gift.

1081
01:12:13,413 --> 01:12:15,624
Otherworldly, you might say.

1082
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:27,969
Here we go.

1083
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:42,651
It's time.

1084
01:12:43,652 --> 01:12:45,987
Gateway is weaker
than I thought.

1085
01:12:47,906 --> 01:12:50,325
They'll break through
sooner than expected.

1086
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:52,035
Bring 'em all in.

1087
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:55,455
What do you want to do
about the RIPD?

1088
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:00,126
I got plans for them.

1089
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:14,808
Mabel! Mabel!

1090
01:13:15,475 --> 01:13:16,560
Help!

1091
01:13:17,769 --> 01:13:20,939
You stay down. You stay
calm. Think of Charlotte!

1092
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:24,818
Let me go with him.

1093
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:25,902
Let me go with him!

1094
01:13:25,986 --> 01:13:27,487
We wanna go in! We wanna help!

1095
01:13:27,571 --> 01:13:28,572
I bet you do.

1096
01:13:30,198 --> 01:13:31,783
RIPD scum.

1097
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:34,536
Hey, Joan, been a long time.

1098
01:13:35,537 --> 01:13:37,664
Still got this famous
blade of yours.

1099
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:43,044
As ex-RIPD, I can tell you
what these two really look like.

1100
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:45,338
No.

1101
01:13:45,422 --> 01:13:47,215
I can see them.

1102
01:13:50,427 --> 01:13:52,887
I can see everything.

1103
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:56,016
And I can tell you
it's too late for you

1104
01:13:56,099 --> 01:13:58,101
and your department, I'm afraid.

1105
01:13:58,977 --> 01:14:03,064
Tomorrow your RIPD will be
useless against our numbers.

1106
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:08,320
When the gateway opens wide,
deados will take over.

1107
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:11,823
And I'm gonna rule over
them all as I turn Earth

1108
01:14:11,906 --> 01:14:15,910
into the tenth circle of Hell.

1109
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:19,247
Ah!

1110
01:14:19,748 --> 01:14:21,708
Just before dawn,
bring them in so that

1111
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:23,376
I can throw them into the abyss

1112
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:26,129
before the gateway
closes once again.

1113
01:14:34,596 --> 01:14:37,682
And for someone who
hates fire as much as you,

1114
01:14:38,475 --> 01:14:39,768
Jeanne D'Arc,

1115
01:14:40,435 --> 01:14:42,812
you'll be bathing in it
for all eternity.

1116
01:14:45,357 --> 01:14:46,858
Whoa-ho.

1117
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:52,697
The irony
is so gloriously delicious.

1118
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,911
Do not let them
out of your sight.

1119
01:15:07,796 --> 01:15:10,382
Jeanne D'Arc? Joan?

1120
01:15:10,465 --> 01:15:12,676
445 years dead?

1121
01:15:12,759 --> 01:15:15,095
I think pretty quick on
my feet. I figured it out.

1122
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:17,097
You're...
Joan of Arc.

1123
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:18,348
Wow.

1124
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:20,016
Joan.

1125
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:23,561
If it's all right with you, I'm just
gonna keep calling you Jean.

1126
01:15:23,645 --> 01:15:26,106
Jeanne.
Jean, Jeanne, same thing.

1127
01:15:27,065 --> 01:15:30,860
Joan of Arc, first partner this
lone wolf has ever really needed.

1128
01:15:32,112 --> 01:15:35,156
And I've enjoyed having you
as my fourth partner.

1129
01:15:36,658 --> 01:15:37,659
Roycephus.

1130
01:15:37,742 --> 01:15:40,954
Well, let's hope those
other three are really with us,

1131
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:42,956
'cause we're gonna need
all the help we can muster

1132
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:44,165
to get the hell out of here.

1133
01:15:51,506 --> 01:15:53,174
Harder. Dig harder.

1134
01:15:57,804 --> 01:15:58,847
Get him up.

1135
01:15:58,972 --> 01:16:01,725
Get up. No, no, no.
Please, I can help.

1136
01:16:01,808 --> 01:16:03,810
- Come on.
- Back to work!

1137
01:16:24,998 --> 01:16:27,292
I can feel it now.

1138
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:32,422
In three...

1139
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:34,132
Two...

1140
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:36,968
One.

1141
01:17:38,071 --> 01:17:41,115
So if they can get
this gateway open,

1142
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:43,493
is there anything
that can close it?

1143
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:47,539
Yes. But we'll need
to extinguish the hellfire.

1144
01:17:48,206 --> 01:17:50,250
Only one thing can do that.

1145
01:17:50,917 --> 01:17:53,711
<i>During the Siege of Orleans,
when I was alive,</i>

1146
01:17:54,712 --> 01:17:58,049
<i>I broke ranks to assess the
damage done to our houses of God...</i>

1147
01:17:58,716 --> 01:18:00,885
God, have mercy on their souls.

1148
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:06,599
<i>I discovered something
truly magnificent.</i>

1149
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:12,230
<i>The Tears of Christ.</i>

1150
01:18:13,106 --> 01:18:16,025
Hey, y'all. Room for
one more at this party?

1151
01:18:16,109 --> 01:18:19,028
Well, well, well. Look
what the cat dragged in.

1152
01:18:19,112 --> 01:18:20,530
Didn't think we'd see you again.

1153
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:22,657
Shut up, Cooper.
You talk too much.

1154
01:18:23,908 --> 01:18:27,662
Mm. How does it feel being
on the "Royceiphing" end?

1155
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,665
Oh, that's hers, ain't it?

1156
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:32,876
Yeah.

1157
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,086
It's big.

1158
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,257
Whoa. Take it easy.

1159
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:41,175
Not after the way
she's treated me.

1160
01:18:41,259 --> 01:18:42,886
This is not
what's planned for her.

1161
01:18:42,969 --> 01:18:44,679
You don't wanna
go against orders.

1162
01:18:46,931 --> 01:18:48,308
Well, how about her, then?

1163
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:50,476
I really feel like
shooting somebody.

1164
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:52,020
I get that.

1165
01:18:52,812 --> 01:18:54,147
Oh, you do?

1166
01:18:54,564 --> 01:18:55,815
Well, that's great!

1167
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,844
Well, do you trust me now?

1168
01:19:27,013 --> 01:19:28,264
So before I let you out,

1169
01:19:28,348 --> 01:19:31,267
I want you to promise me,
my soul gets a retrial.

1170
01:19:31,351 --> 01:19:33,478
I want my current
judgement revoked.

1171
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:37,023
That's rare, but not impossible.

1172
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:39,776
You let us out,
and I'll see to it.

1173
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:43,821
And you.

1174
01:19:45,615 --> 01:19:47,617
Before I let you out,
you need to see this.

1175
01:19:49,619 --> 01:19:51,704
Remember, Butterfield
owns a printing press,

1176
01:19:51,788 --> 01:19:53,289
and like I said, I was framed.

1177
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:55,458
I told you the bills
weren't official.

1178
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:57,251
Butterfield had
them fake ones made.

1179
01:19:57,710 --> 01:20:00,421
Your beef is with him,
not me, Roycephus.

1180
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:03,591
Call me Roy.

1181
01:20:23,194 --> 01:20:25,321
All right, listen to me. We
gotta try and get out of here.

1182
01:20:26,447 --> 01:20:28,282
We gotta get out right now! No!

1183
01:20:28,366 --> 01:20:30,451
Daddy! No!

1184
01:20:32,203 --> 01:20:33,204
Please...

1185
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:38,376
No!

1186
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:41,838
He's gone! He's been
taken! Look at me!

1187
01:20:41,921 --> 01:20:43,840
Your daddy's gone.
We have to go!

1188
01:20:49,262 --> 01:20:51,806
These tears need to be dropped
into the eye of the hellfire,

1189
01:20:51,889 --> 01:20:53,141
dead center in the gateway.

1190
01:20:53,224 --> 01:20:55,435
Only then will it seal,
sucking everything in with it.

1191
01:20:55,518 --> 01:20:56,853
Means we gotta get
those humans out first.

1192
01:20:57,603 --> 01:20:58,604
Exactly.

1193
01:20:59,564 --> 01:21:00,565
Now go.

1194
01:21:01,149 --> 01:21:02,483
Uh, you're coming with.

1195
01:21:02,567 --> 01:21:05,111
I can't, Roy. I...
I just can't.

1196
01:21:06,154 --> 01:21:07,321
Go! Go!

1197
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:13,995
Just stay with me. You'll
get out. Just stay with me.

1198
01:21:25,006 --> 01:21:26,591
Come on!
I think I get it!

1199
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:30,595
Don't look at them!

1200
01:21:30,678 --> 01:21:32,680
Avert your eyes!

1201
01:21:32,764 --> 01:21:34,223
Avert your eyes!

1202
01:21:35,475 --> 01:21:38,436
You've got fire in you that's greater
than anything that ever came out of Hell.

1203
01:21:38,519 --> 01:21:40,104
You got this.
Come on, now!

1204
01:21:40,188 --> 01:21:42,356
Not a moment has passed
since I was burned at the stake

1205
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,567
that I have not heard
my own dying screams.

1206
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:47,862
I can't do fire, Roy.

1207
01:21:48,738 --> 01:21:49,739
I'm sorry.

1208
01:21:50,156 --> 01:21:51,199
Bring me in.

1209
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:55,578
Hey, partner.

1210
01:21:56,329 --> 01:22:00,083
You've been safeguarding
these for 445 years.

1211
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:02,168
This is your moment.

1212
01:22:10,093 --> 01:22:12,720
Make them open their eyes!

1213
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:18,643
Make them look!

1214
01:22:28,528 --> 01:22:29,904
I didn't call for them.

1215
01:22:29,987 --> 01:22:31,614
No choice,
the other one rebelled.

1216
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:33,699
Took out Cooper and Brooks
before I got her.

1217
01:22:33,783 --> 01:22:34,909
What should I do with this one?

1218
01:22:34,992 --> 01:22:36,119
Just throw him in!

1219
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:44,627
Ready?
Mmm-hmm.

1220
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:45,711
Set.
Mmm-hmm.

1221
01:22:45,837 --> 01:22:46,838
Go!

1222
01:23:01,769 --> 01:23:03,437
This way. Come on.

1223
01:23:03,896 --> 01:23:04,897
Come on.

1224
01:23:09,944 --> 01:23:12,613
Go help Angus and the others.
I'm gonna find me this Otis.

1225
01:23:12,697 --> 01:23:13,698
Okay.

1226
01:23:14,282 --> 01:23:15,867
Close your eyes!
Close your eyes!

1227
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:16,951
Come on, come on, come on!

1228
01:23:17,034 --> 01:23:18,411
Keep your eyes closed!
Go! Move!

1229
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:20,037
Go! Go!

1230
01:23:20,538 --> 01:23:21,539
Watch out!
No!

1231
01:23:27,170 --> 01:23:28,671
Let's go! Come on!

1232
01:23:41,809 --> 01:23:43,144
Whoa!

1233
01:24:06,834 --> 01:24:08,544
I get it. It's hot.

1234
01:24:08,836 --> 01:24:10,379
It's gonna get
a whole lot hotter.

1235
01:24:12,757 --> 01:24:13,966
Please. Please.

1236
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:15,343
No, no, no, no...

1237
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,185
Get out of here. Go!

1238
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:38,741
Keep your eyes closed!

1239
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:39,825
Keep your eyes closed!

1240
01:24:39,951 --> 01:24:41,369
Come on! Go!

1241
01:24:41,494 --> 01:24:42,828
Go! Feel!

1242
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,090
We need to hold on.

1243
01:26:02,408 --> 01:26:04,076
Hold on!

1244
01:26:25,097 --> 01:26:26,515
Hey, it's over.

1245
01:26:26,599 --> 01:26:27,641
It's over.

1246
01:26:31,604 --> 01:26:33,939
That's some powerful tears
you got there.

1247
01:26:34,899 --> 01:26:37,943
And the wretched
are where they belong.

1248
01:26:39,278 --> 01:26:41,072
And Otis, too,
from the looks of it.

1249
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:48,120
Thanks for showing up
when you did.

1250
01:26:48,204 --> 01:26:49,914
You didn't give me much choice.

1251
01:26:51,248 --> 01:26:53,709
Little help, please.

1252
01:26:56,462 --> 01:26:57,463
Come on.

1253
01:27:02,259 --> 01:27:03,636
Oh, it's really in there.

1254
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:05,721
Yes, it's like the Earth
is tightened around it.

1255
01:27:06,263 --> 01:27:10,393
Your interference
is really testing my patience.

1256
01:27:28,786 --> 01:27:32,581
Appears I'll have to wait
another 25 years

1257
01:27:32,665 --> 01:27:34,083
for this opportunity.

1258
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:35,501
Astaroth!

1259
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:38,587
As... What?
What's an Astaroth?

1260
01:27:40,172 --> 01:27:41,924
One-third of the evil trinity.

1261
01:27:42,883 --> 01:27:44,969
The right hand
to the devil himself.

1262
01:27:45,261 --> 01:27:48,931
Until I rose to establish
my own throne here on Earth.

1263
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:51,434
And you're not gonna
stop me this time!

1264
01:28:06,449 --> 01:28:07,950
I've lost the tears, Roy.

1265
01:28:13,539 --> 01:28:14,999
I've got to get to my sword.

1266
01:28:18,127 --> 01:28:19,128
Hold on, now.

1267
01:28:20,171 --> 01:28:21,714
Look what got left behind.

1268
01:28:26,677 --> 01:28:28,220
Relax. I got this.

1269
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:30,639
Hey, Asshole-roth!

1270
01:29:38,582 --> 01:29:42,294
Nothing more humiliating
than having your soul taken

1271
01:29:42,378 --> 01:29:44,964
by your own weapon, huh?

1272
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:51,011
The tears.

1273
01:29:51,095 --> 01:29:53,222
Let there be something left.

1274
01:30:34,722 --> 01:30:36,307
Eat your heart out,
Annie Oakley.

1275
01:31:08,088 --> 01:31:11,842
<i>I'm quite sure Butterfield does
not expect us to settle our tab.</i>

1276
01:31:12,885 --> 01:31:15,387
No, but we got
some unfinished business.

1277
01:31:17,473 --> 01:31:19,141
I never meant
to kill that Sheriff!

1278
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:20,225
Let's go.
Please.

1279
01:31:20,309 --> 01:31:21,435
You got to believe me.

1280
01:31:21,518 --> 01:31:23,354
I found him cowering
under the bed.

1281
01:31:23,437 --> 01:31:25,064
Go on, tell him the truth!

1282
01:31:27,066 --> 01:31:29,276
When Otis took over my town,

1283
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:31,528
I tried to escape.

1284
01:31:31,612 --> 01:31:33,822
Caught me a train
across the border.

1285
01:31:33,906 --> 01:31:35,783
Just so it happened,
them Samuel bandits

1286
01:31:35,866 --> 01:31:37,951
were working over Horseshoe
at the same time,

1287
01:31:38,035 --> 01:31:40,954
stealing more folks for Otis
as the train passed through.

1288
01:31:41,038 --> 01:31:43,374
<i>I didn't want them Samuels
bringing me back.</i>

1289
01:31:45,334 --> 01:31:47,086
<i>So, when I fired that gun...</i>

1290
01:31:47,169 --> 01:31:49,421
<i>I thought I was shooting
one of them.</i>

1291
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:50,881
Butterfield!

1292
01:31:50,964 --> 01:31:53,467
No. No, come here.

1293
01:31:54,093 --> 01:31:55,177
Go on!

1294
01:31:55,928 --> 01:31:57,429
I knew he was there.

1295
01:31:57,513 --> 01:31:59,973
I knew he was the weakest.

1296
01:32:00,641 --> 01:32:03,977
I had them fake bills printed
in order to save my own hide.

1297
01:32:04,061 --> 01:32:07,481
Why do you women even care
so much about that damn Sheriff?

1298
01:32:07,564 --> 01:32:11,068
I know what Marcus Aurelius
thinks about revenge.

1299
01:32:11,151 --> 01:32:13,445
But what does the Bible say,
and make it quick?

1300
01:32:13,529 --> 01:32:17,991
Roy, if I start quoting the Bible,
Butterfield will die of old age.

1301
01:32:18,492 --> 01:32:21,161
You know what to do.

1302
01:32:25,749 --> 01:32:29,169
I heard that you lost your
lawman up there last night.

1303
01:32:29,253 --> 01:32:32,923
Is there anyone that you or the
town wanna elect as new Sheriff?

1304
01:32:33,549 --> 01:32:34,883
Yes, there is.

1305
01:32:36,343 --> 01:32:37,344
Him.

1306
01:32:37,928 --> 01:32:38,929
Me?
Him?

1307
01:32:39,722 --> 01:32:41,432
And I'm going to be his Deputy.

1308
01:32:43,183 --> 01:32:44,309
All right, then.

1309
01:32:45,811 --> 01:32:48,313
You saw firsthand
where you're gonna end up.

1310
01:32:48,397 --> 01:32:51,108
There ain't nothing worse
that I can to you than that.

1311
01:32:51,191 --> 01:32:53,527
Take him away. Lock him up.

1312
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:54,903
Deputy.

1313
01:32:57,322 --> 01:32:58,615
Let's go!

1314
01:32:58,699 --> 01:33:00,492
Julius.
Ah!

1315
01:33:01,410 --> 01:33:03,245
Release me!
Deado outlaw...

1316
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:06,290
...to deado lawman. You've
come a long way, son.

1317
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:10,586
I guess you've earned the right
for us to know who you really are.

1318
01:33:10,669 --> 01:33:12,129
Should we call you Bumble?

1319
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:16,008
No. Keep calling me Slim.

1320
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:18,510
I intend on bringing
only honor to the name.

1321
01:33:18,594 --> 01:33:21,722
We'll come get you when
your soul's retrial has been set.

1322
01:33:21,805 --> 01:33:23,348
But you step out of line here,

1323
01:33:23,432 --> 01:33:25,184
and we'll be coming back
for a whole different reason.

1324
01:33:26,268 --> 01:33:27,728
Message Roy-ceiphed.

1325
01:33:34,234 --> 01:33:35,903
Well...

1326
01:33:36,278 --> 01:33:40,908
I guess us ladies need to go
shopping for a couple of dresses.

1327
01:33:40,991 --> 01:33:41,992
Because...

1328
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:48,081
We cannot go to my daughter's
wedding looking like this!

1329
01:33:51,752 --> 01:33:53,003
Yeah, whatever that means!

1330
01:33:53,086 --> 01:33:55,798
It means, "Oh, my God!"

1331
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:04,515
Ladies and gentlemen, I present
to you Mr. and Mrs. Parker!

1332
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:08,101
Thank you so much.

1333
01:34:08,185 --> 01:34:09,311
Thank you.

1334
01:34:09,394 --> 01:34:10,729
Thank you.

1335
01:34:10,813 --> 01:34:12,356
There they are.
Come on.

1336
01:34:12,439 --> 01:34:14,066
One second, one second.
Come on, come on.

1337
01:34:14,858 --> 01:34:16,151
Well, now.

1338
01:34:16,235 --> 01:34:18,779
Don't you two look
simply magnificent?

1339
01:34:19,321 --> 01:34:23,408
Good luck, Angus. After today you'll
face a far greater challenge than Hell.

1340
01:34:23,492 --> 01:34:24,701
Marriage.

1341
01:34:24,785 --> 01:34:26,620
And you're gonna love
every second of it.

1342
01:34:26,787 --> 01:34:28,288
Uh...

1343
01:34:28,372 --> 01:34:29,665
Are you okay, Mabel?

1344
01:34:29,748 --> 01:34:31,792
'Cause I didn't understand
a word that you just said.

1345
01:34:35,879 --> 01:34:40,509
I think my sister must have
burned her tongue up there.

1346
01:34:40,592 --> 01:34:43,887
She said she couldn't be happier

1347
01:34:43,971 --> 01:34:47,391
for you and your beautiful wife.

1348
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:26,179
I know I just met her,

1349
01:35:26,263 --> 01:35:29,057
but it feels like I've known
Mabel my whole life.

1350
01:35:29,141 --> 01:35:30,434
I know.

1351
01:35:31,393 --> 01:35:32,936
She is very...

1352
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:34,479
...otherworldly.

1353
01:35:40,277 --> 01:35:43,238
<i>So tell me why Angus
can't understand me now.</i>

1354
01:35:43,322 --> 01:35:46,617
Because now that you've
approved of your daughter's marriage,

1355
01:35:48,368 --> 01:35:51,955
your soul considers
Angus a loved one.

1356
01:35:52,039 --> 01:35:53,206
Hmm.

1357
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:58,629
So, uh, what are we gonna do
with these here horses?

1358
01:35:59,504 --> 01:36:00,589
Let them go.

1359
01:36:00,672 --> 01:36:02,966
They'll be here for us
whenever we need them.

1360
01:36:10,265 --> 01:36:13,018
You know, I've
been thinking, I get it.

1361
01:36:13,101 --> 01:36:15,979
You're RIPD for the
rest of your afterlife.

1362
01:36:16,063 --> 01:36:18,690
Duty, honor, servitude
and all that.

1363
01:36:19,191 --> 01:36:23,654
But between you and me and
the fence post, I reckon' I'm done.

1364
01:36:24,321 --> 01:36:27,574
As soon as we're done
with this shitty ride here,

1365
01:36:27,658 --> 01:36:30,994
I'm gonna tell Hano
to open up that portal

1366
01:36:31,078 --> 01:36:34,539
point me towards the sweet
warmth of eternal glory,

1367
01:36:35,207 --> 01:36:36,792
and send me on my way.

1368
01:36:39,252 --> 01:36:41,004
I want you to know,

1369
01:36:41,088 --> 01:36:44,591
I'm real glad to have served
with you and the RIPD,

1370
01:36:46,176 --> 01:36:47,344
partner.

1371
01:36:55,727 --> 01:36:59,481
What...
What's funny?

1372
01:36:59,564 --> 01:37:02,025
You didn't read
your contract, did you?

1373
01:37:02,109 --> 01:37:04,236
Hell, no. That thing
was thicker than Slim.

1374
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:07,614
Well, eternal glory
does await you, Roy,

1375
01:37:08,824 --> 01:37:13,412
but only after you served your
minimum 100-year contract term.

1376
01:37:14,246 --> 01:37:16,665
One hundred years?
Mmm-hmm.

1377
01:37:16,748 --> 01:37:20,544
Looks like you and me aren't
done with each other yet, partner.

1378
01:37:23,714 --> 01:37:24,715
Come on!

1379
01:37:34,516 --> 01:37:35,726
God damn it.

1380
01:37:36,643 --> 01:37:37,644
Sorry, boss.

1381
01:37:37,769 --> 01:37:40,355
What I meant to say was...
Damn it!
